# Python GUI note taking app

## Learning summary

While learning the Java programming language, I have produced a console rendition of the *Snake* game as one of my projects. This project implements a responsive main menu and a game loop that features collision detection between the snake head, it's body, the food and the borders.

* Java programming language: I have  learned  the syntax of Java  as well  as learning how to use useful utility functionality provided by either Java itself of external libraries like Apache Commons.

* Object-oriented programming: while working on this project, I have learned the rudimentary elements of object-oriented programming. For instance, I learned the benefits of using abstraction in my design, making the attributes in my `Snake` and `Food` classes private (accessible via get/set methods which have inbuilt validation). I also learned how these concepts apply to the Java programming language. For example, learning about static methods or  Enum  constructors in Java expanded my horizon as to what OOP could look like.

* Problem-solving using maths: since this project is a game, I had to devise a method to display an image to the console. To make this work, I had to employ co-ordinates and vector math in my algorithms to be able to calculate the movement of the `Snake`, if it eats the `Food` or not, and so on. Furthermore, I had to learn the math behind datastructures, so I could efficiently represent all this co-ordinate data as a single Java Array that I could display as an image.

-> sql database (sqlite 3/searching data/creating records/deleting records/modifying values)
-> encryption (symmetric AES data + salting)
-> passwords (hashing + salting)
-> OOP (heavy oop usage (everything is an object)/oop patterns like singletons)
-> gui design (tkinter)
-> problem solving: implementing callback functions on action objects to enable scene switching
-> python programming language: learning more advanced syntax like `**kwargs` and `cls.something` and `__new__()`
